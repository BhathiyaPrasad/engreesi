  <div className="chat-bubble text-xl bg-accent text-white">Of course! This temple is called the "Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic," and it has a rich history dating back to ancient times. It houses a tooth relic of Buddha, which is highly revered by Buddhists in Sri Lanka.</div>

  <div className="chat-bubble text-xl bg-accent text-white">Well, one of the main rituals is the daily "Dalada Perahera," a grand procession where the sacred tooth relic is paraded through the streets of Kandy. It's a major cultural event with traditional dances, music, and beautifully adorned elephants.</div>

  <div className="chat-bubble text-xl bg-accent text-white">Visitors should dress modestly when entering the temple. It's customary to cover your shoulders and knees, and it's a sign of respect. You can also borrow shawls or sarongs at the entrance if needed.</div>

  <div className="chat-bubble text-xl bg-accent text-white">The early mornings are the best time for meditation. It's quiet, and the temple complex is bathed in a peaceful atmosphere. You can sit by the beautiful Kandy Lake nearby and enjoy the tranquility.</div>
