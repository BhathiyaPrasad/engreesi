  <div className="chat-bubble text-xl bg-[#171717] text-white">I'm in the same boat. I mean, it can be fun, but I'm not always a fan of big parties with coworkers.</div>

  <div className="chat-bubble text-xl bg-accent text-white">Exactly, the whole 'office party' thing can get a bit awkward sometimes. Plus, it's on a weekend, and I could use some rest.</div>

  <div className="chat-bubble text-xl bg-[#171717] text-white">That's true. On the other hand, it's a good opportunity to socialize and network. We might even enjoy it more than we expect.</div>

  <div className="chat-bubble text-xl bg-accent text-white">You have a point, Supuni. I'll think it over. Maybe a little change of scenery and some fun with colleagues won't hurt.</div>
