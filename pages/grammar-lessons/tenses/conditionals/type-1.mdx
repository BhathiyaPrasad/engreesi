# Conditional Type 1

The type 1 conditional refers to a possible condition and its probable result. These sentences are based on facts, and they are used to make statements about the real world, and about particular situations. We often use such sentences to give warnings. In type 1 conditional sentences, **the time is the present or future and the situation is real**.

> Examples
>
> - If I have time, I'll finish that letter.
> - What will you do if you miss the plane?
> - Nobody will notice if you make a mistake.
> - If you drop that glass, it will break.
> - If you don't drop the gun, I'll shoot!
> - If you don't leave, I'll call the police.

In sentences, you can also use modals in the main clause instead of the future tense to express the degree of certainty, permission, or a recommendation about the outcome.

> Examples
>
> - If you drop that glass, it might break.
> - I may finish that letter if I have time.
> - If he calls you, you should go.
> - If you buy my school supplies for me, I will be able to go to the park.

## Structure

In a type 1 conditional sentence, the tense in the "if" clause is the simple present, and the tense in the main clause is the simple future.

| If clause               | Main clause      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| `if` + `Simple Present` | `Simple Future`  |
| If this happens,        | that will happen |

As in all conditional sentences, the order of the clauses is not fixed. You may have to rearrange the pronouns and adjust punctuation when you change the order of the clauses, but the meaning is identical.

> Examples
>
> - If it rains, you will get wet.
>   - You will get wet if it rains.
> - If Sally is late again I will be mad.
>   - I will be mad if Sally is late again.
> - If you don't hurry, you will miss the bus.
>   - You will miss the bus if you don't hurry.
