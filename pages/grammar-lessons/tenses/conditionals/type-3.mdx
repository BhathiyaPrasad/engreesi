# Conditional Type 3

The type 3 conditional refers to an impossible condition in the past and its probable result in the past. These sentences are truly hypothetical and unreal, because it is now too late for the condition or its result to exist. There is always some implication of regret with type 3 conditional sentences. The reality is the opposite of, or contrary to, what the sentence expresses. In type 3 conditional sentences, **the time is the past and the situation is hypothetical**.

> Examples
>
> - If I had worked harder, I would have passed the exam.
>   - _(But... I didn't work hard, and I didn't pass the exam.)_
> - If I had known you were coming, I would have baked a cake.
>   - _(But... I didn't know and I didn't bake a cake.)_
> - I would have been happy if you had called me on my birthday.
>   - _(But... you didn't call me and I am not happy.)_

In type 3 conditional sentences, you can also use modals in the main clause instead of "would" to express the degree of certainty, permission, or a recommendation about the outcome.

> Examples
>
> - If I had worked harder, I might have passed the exam.
> - You could have been on time if you had caught the bus.
> - If he called you, you could go.
> - If you bought another ticket for me, I might be able to join you.

## Structure

In a type 3 conditional sentence, the tense in the "if" clause is the past perfect, and the tense in the main clause is the conditional perfect or the conditional perfect continuous.

| If clause             | Main clause                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `if` + `Past Perfect` | `Conditional Perfect`            |
| If this had happened, | that would have happened         |
|                       | --                               |
| `if` + `Past Perfect` | `Conditional Perfect Continuous` |
| If this had happened, | that would have been happening   |

As in all conditional sentences, the order of the clauses is not fixed. You may have to rearrange the pronouns and adjust punctuation when you change the order of the clauses, but the meaning is identical.

> Examples
>
> - If it had rained, you would have gotten wet.
>   - You would have gotten wet if it had rained.
> - You would have passed your exam if you had worked harder.
>   - If you had worked harder, you would have passed your exam.
> - I would have believed you if you hadn't lied to me before.
>   - If you hadn't lied to me before, I would have believed you.

## Contractions

Both `would` and `had` can be contracted to `'d`, which can be confusing for some learners. Remember these 2 rules:

1. `would` never appears in the if-clause so if `'d` appears in the if clause, it must be abbreviating `had`.

2. `had` never appears before `have` so if `'d` appears on a pronoun just before have, it must be abbreviating `would`.
