# Past Perfect

## Usage

The past perfect refers to a time earlier than before now. It is used to make it clear that **one event happened before another in the past**. It does not matter which event is mentioned first - the tense makes it clear which one happened first.

In these examples, Event A is the event that happened first and Event B is the second or more recent event:

| Event A           | Event B                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| John had gone out | when I arrived in the office. |

| Event A                 | Event B                      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| I had saved my document | before the computer crashed. |

| Event B           | Event A                         |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| When they arrived | we had already started cooking. |

| Event B           | Event A                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| He was very tired | because he hadn't slept well. |

### Past Perfect + `just`

`just`` is used with the past perfect to refer to an event that was only a short time earlier than before now.

> Examples:
>
> - The train **had just left** when I arrived at the station.
> - She **had just left** the room when the police arrived.
> - I **had just put** the washing out when it started to rain.
