## Usage

As with all tenses in English, the **speaker's attitude** is as important as the time of the action or event. When someone uses the present continuous, they are thinking about something that is **unfinished or incomplete**.

The present continuous is used for the following purposes.

To describe an action that is going on at this moment:

> Examples
>
> - You are using the Internet.
> - You are studying English grammar.

To describe an action that is going on during this period of time or a trend:

> Examples
>
> - Are you still working for the same company?
> - More and more people are becoming vegetarian.

To describe an action or event in the future, which has already been planned or prepared:

> Examples
>
> - We're going on holiday tomorrow.
> - I'm meeting my boyfriend tonight.
> - Are they visiting you next winter?

To describe a temporary event or situation:

> Examples
>
> - He usually plays the drums, but he's playing bass guitar tonight.
> - The weather forecast was good, but it's raining at the moment.

with "always, forever, constantly", to describe and emphasise a continuing series of repeated actions:

> Examples
>
> - Harry and Sally are always arguing!
> - You're constantly complaining about your mother-in-law!
