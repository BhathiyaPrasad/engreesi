# Present Perfect Continuous

The present perfect continuous is used to refer to an unspecified time between 'before now' and 'now'. The speaker is thinking about something that started but perhaps did not finish in that period of time. They are interested in the **process as well as the result**, and this process may still be going on, or may have just finished.

## Subject-Verb Agreement

The present perfect continuous is made up of two elements: the present perfect of the verb 'to be' (have/has been), and the present participle of the main verb (base+ing).
