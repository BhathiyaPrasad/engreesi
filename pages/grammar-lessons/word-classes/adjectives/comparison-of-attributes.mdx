# Comparison of Attributes

When comparing the attributes of two things, we use a standard set of constructions.

## When attributes are equal

Comparing equal attributes is simple. To compare the attributes of two things that are equal, we use the pattern:

> as + `Adjective` + as

> Examples
>
> - Tom is _**as tall as** his brother_.
> - I am _**as hungry as** you_ are.
> - Sally is _**as nice as** Jane_.

## When attributes are not equal

When the two attributes are not equal, there are three constructions with equivalent meanings.

Either use the pattern:

> not as + `Adjective` + as

Or use the pattern:

> less + `Adjective` + than

_This construction is more frequent with some adjectives than with others._

Or use the pattern:

> `Comparative Adjective` + than

_This construction may require changing the order of the phrase or using the opposing adjective._

> Examples
>
> - Mont Blanc is not _**as high as** Mount Everest_.
> - Mont Blanc is _**less high than** Mount Everest_.
> - Mont Blanc is _**lower than** Mount Everest_.
> - Mount Everest is _**higher than** Mont Blanc_.
> - Norway is not _**as sunny as** Thailand_.
> - Norway is _**less sunny than** Thailand_.
> - Thailand is _**sunnier than** Norway_.
> - Norway is _**cloudier than** Thailand_.
