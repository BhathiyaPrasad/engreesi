# Adverbs

Adverbs are a very broad collection of words that may describe how, where, or when an action took place. They may also express the viewpoint of the speaker about the action, the intensity of an adjective or another adverb, or several other functions.

> Examples
>
> - The bus moved **slowly**.
> - The bears ate **greedily**.
> - The car drove **fast**.

Sometimes adverbs modify adjectives, making them stronger or weaker.

> Examples
>
> - You look **absolutely** fabulous!
> - He is **slightly** overweight.
> - You are **very** persistent.

Some types of adverbs can modify other adverbs, changing their degree or precision.

> Examples
>
> - She played the violin **extremely** well.
> - You're speaking **too** quietly.
