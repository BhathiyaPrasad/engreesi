# Adverbs from Adjectives

In most cases, an adverb is formed by adding `-ly` to an adjective

| Adjective | Adverb  |
| --------- | ------- |
| cheap     | cheaply |
| quick     | quickly |
| slow      | slowly  |

If the adjective ends in `-y`, replace the `-y` with `-i` and add `-ly`

| Adjective | Adverb  |
| --------- | ------- |
| easy      | easily  |
| angry     | angrily |
| happy     | happily |
| lucky     | luckily |

If the adjective ends in `-able`, `-ible`, or `-le`, replace the `-e` with `-y`.

| Adjective | Adverb   |
| --------- | -------- |
| probable  | probably |
| terrible  | terribly |
| gentle    | gently   |

If the adjective ends in `-ic`, add `-ally`. Exception: _`public`_ ➡️  _`publicly`_

| Adjective | Adverb       |
| --------- | ------------ |
| basic     | basically    |
| tragic    | tragically   |
| economic  | economically |

Some adverbs have the same form as the adjective: _`early`_, _`fast`_, _`hard`_, _`high`_, _`late`_, _`near`_, _`straight`_, _`wrong`_

> Examples
>
> - It is a **fast** car. `(Adjective)`
> - He drives very **fast**. `(Adverb)`
> - This is a **hard** exercise. `(Adjective)`
> - He works **hard**. `(Adverb)`
> - We saw many **high** buildings. `(Adjective)`
> - The bird flew **high** in the sky. `(Adverb)`

_`well`_ is the adverb that corresponds to the adjective _`good`_.

> Examples
>
> - He is a _**good** student_. `(Adjective)`
> - He studies **well**. `(Adverb)`
> - She is a _**good** pianist_. `(Adjective)`
> - She plays the piano **well**. `(Adverb)`
> - They are _**good** swimmers_. `(Adjective)`
> - They swim **well**. `(Adverb)`
