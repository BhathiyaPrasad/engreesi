# Adverbs of Certainty

Adverbs of certainty express how certain we feel about an action or event. Adverbs of certainty go before the main verb unless the main verb is a form of `be`, in which case the adverb of certainty goes after.

> Examples
>
> - He _**definitely** left_ the house this morning.
> - He _**surely** won't forget_.
> - He _is **probably**_ in the park.
> - He _is **certainly**_ a smart man.

If there is an auxiliary verb, the adverb of certainty goes between the auxiliary and the main verb.

> Examples
>
> - He _has **certainly** forgotten_ the meeting.
> - He _will **probably** remember_ tomorrow.
> - He _is **definitely** running_ late.

Sometimes these adverbs of certainty can be placed at the beginning of the sentence.

> Examples
>
> - **Undoubtedly**, Winston Churchill was a great politician.
> - **Certainly**, I will be there.
> - **Probably**, he has forgotten the meeting.

When the adverb of certainty `surely` is placed at the beginning of the sentence, it means the speaker thinks something is true, but is looking for confirmation.

> Examples
>
> **Surely** you've got a bicycle.
> **Surely** you're not going to wear that to the party.
