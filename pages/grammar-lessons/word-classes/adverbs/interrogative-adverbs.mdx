# Interrogative Adverbs

The interrogative adverbs `why`, `where`, `how`, & `when` are placed at the beginning of a question. These questions can be answered with a sentence or a prepositional phrase. After an interrogative adverb in a question, you must invert the subject and verb so that the verb comes first.

> Examples
>
> - **Why** are you so late? There was a lot of traffic.
> - **Where** is my passport? In the drawer.
> - **How** are you? I'm fine.
> - **When** does the train arrive? At 11:15.

## Uses of how

How can be used to form questions in four different ways. How can be used by itself to mean "in what way".

> Examples
>
> - **How** did you make this sauce?
> - **How** do you start the car?
> - **How** can I get to your house?

How can be used with adjectives to ask about the degree of an attribute.

> Examples
>
> - **How tall** are you?
> - **How old** is your house?
> - **How angry** is mother?

How can be used with much and many to ask about quantity. Much is used with uncountable nouns and many is used with countable nouns.

> Examples
>

> - **How much** are these tomatoes?

How can be used with other adverbs to ask about the frequency or degree of an action.
