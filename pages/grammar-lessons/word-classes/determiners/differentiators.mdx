# Differntiators

The determiners other and another refer to something different, remaining, or additional. They are placed before a noun. The other is treated separately because its usage is slightly different.

- `other`
  - Plural countable nouns and all uncountable nouns
- `another`
  - Singular countable nouns
- `the other`
  - Any noun that can take the definite article "the"

## `other`

Other can be used alone or after the determiners some, any, and no.

> Examples
>
> - Do you have **other shoes**?
> - There are **other jobs** you could try.
> - Is there **any other bread**?
> - I have **some other sugar** we could use.
> - We have **no other ideas**.

If used with a plural countable noun and one of these determiners, the noun may be omitted when it is understood from the context. In that case, other becomes plural. This can also happen with `other` used by itself, but it is less common.

> Examples
>
> - Do you have **any others**?
> - I know **some others** who might like to come.
> - There are **no others** in this box.
> - I know **others** like vanilla, but I prefer chocolate.
> - She doesn't have to wear that dress. She has **others**.

## `another`

`another` is used with singular countable nouns. For uncountable nouns, `another` is often used with measure words that are singular.

> Examples
>
> - Have **another cookie**.
> - Would you like **another cup of tea**?
> - He has **another brother**.
> - I don't have **another car**.
> - I'll come by **another time**.

## `the other`

If `the other` is modifying a plural countable noun, the noun may be omitted when it is understood from the context. In that case, `other` will become plural.

> Examples
>
> - Where is **the other box** of cereal?
> - I work on the weekend and go to school on **the other days** of the week.
> - May I use **the other honey** for my recipe?
> - I enjoyed the first book but I didn't read **the other books** in the series.
> - Have you seen **the others**?
> - Jim ate two cookies. I ate **the others**.
