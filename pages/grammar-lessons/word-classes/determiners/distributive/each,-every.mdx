# `each` | `every`

Distributive determiners refer to a group of people or things, and to individual members of the group. They show different ways of looking at the individuals within a group, and they express how something is distributed, shared, or divided.

`each` is a way of seeing the members of a group as individuals, while `every` is a way of seeing a group as a series of members. These distributive determiners can only be used with countable nouns. They are normally used with singular nouns, and are placed before the noun. In many cases, they are interchangeable.

> Examples
>
> - `Each` child received a present.
> - `Every` child received a present.
> - I gave `each` plant some water.
> - I gave `every` plant some water.

`each` can also be used with plural nouns and pronouns but must be followed by `of`. `every` cannot be used with plural nouns.

> Examples
>
> - `Each` of the children received a present.
> - I gave `each` of the plants some water.
> - He told `each` of us our jobs.
> - I gave `each` of them a kiss.

`every` can express different points in a series, especially with time expressions. `each` works in the same way, but is less common.

> Examples
>
> - `Every` morning John goes jogging.
> - This magazine is published `every` week.
> - I have my coffee here `every` day.
> - I go visit my mother `each` week.
> - `Each` Monday, he buys a kilo of apples.
