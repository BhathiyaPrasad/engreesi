# Quantifiers

Quantifiers are adjectives and adjectival phrases that give approximate or specific answers to the questions **"How much?"** and **"How many?"**. To answer the questions How much? and How many? certain quantifiers can be used with [C] countable nouns (_`friends`_, _`cups`_, _`people`_), others with [U] uncountable nouns (_`sugar`_, _`tea`_, _`money`_) and still others with all types of nouns.

| Only with [U]     | With all types of nouns | Only with [C]]    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------- |
| (a) little        | no, none, not any       | (a) few           |
|                   | none                    |                   |
|                   | not any                 |                   |
| less              |                         | fewer             |
| least             |                         | fewest            |
| a bit of          | some                    | a number of       |

|                   | enough                  |                   |
| a great deal of   | a lot of                | a great number of |
|                   | lots of                 |                   |
| a large amount of | plenty of               | a large number of |
| much              |                         | many              |
|                   | more                    |                   |
|                   | most                    |                   |

> - Would you like **some tea** and **a few cookies**?
> - I always put **a little cheese** and **some carrots** in my soup.

### `much` or `many`

`much` and `many` are mainly used in interrogative and negative sentences. They are also used in affirmative and negative sentences in combination with too and so.

Note: the word `many` can be used alone in affirmative sentences while the word `much` cannot. `much` is replaced in affirmative sentences with `a lot of` or `lots of` (these expressions can also replace `many`).

## Attitude about quantity

The quantifiers `few` and `a few`, and `little` and `a little` seem nearly identical but they are actually quite distinct. These expressions show the speaker's attitude towards the quantity he is referring to as either positive or negative.

### Positive attitude

`a few` (for countable nouns) and `a little` (for uncountable nouns) describe the quantity in a positive way, implying that although the speaker may not have much, he has enough.

> Examples
>
> - I've got **a few** friends.
>   - _=> I have enough friends._
> - I have **a few** flowers in my garden.
>   - _=> I have enough flowers._
> - I've got **a little** money.
>   - _=> I have enough money._
> - I have **a little** free time on Thursdays.
>   - _=> I have enough free time._

### Negative attitude

`few` (for countable nouns) and `little` (for uncountable nouns) describe the quantity in a negative way. They may actually indicate a lack of what is represented by the noun, but it is more polite than saying so directly.

> Examples
>
> - **Few** people visited him in hospital.
>   - _=> he had almost no visitors, or perhaps no visitors at all._
> - I've seen **few** birds around here.
>   - _=> there are almost no birds, or perhaps not a single bird_
> - He had **little** money for treats.
>   - _=> almost no money, or perhaps no money at all_
> - I have **little** time for TV
>   - _=> almost no time, or perhaps no time at all_

`some` and `any` can be used with countable and uncountable nouns to describe an undefined or incomplete quantity.

## Using "some"

`some` can be used in descriptive sentences.

> Examples
>
> - I had **some** rice for lunch.
> - He got **some** books from the library.
> - I will have **some** news next week.
> - Philip wants **some** help with his exams.
> - There is **some** butter in the fridge.

`some` is also used in interrogative sentences when you think you already know the answer.

> Examples
>
> - Did he give you **some tea**?
>   - _=> I think he did._
> - Is there **some fruit juice** in the fridge?
>   - _=> I think there is._
> - Would you like **some help**?
>   - _=> Probably you do._
> - Will you have **some roast beef**?
>   - _=> Probably you will_

`some` can also be used in interrogative sentences to ask for something or to offer something.

> Examples
>
> - Could I have **some books**, please?
> - Why don't you take **some apples** home with you?
> - Would you like **some tea**?
> - Will you have **some cake**?

## Using "any"

`any` is used in interrogative sentences when you do not know the answer.

> Examples
>
> - Do you have any friends in London?
> - Do they have any children?
> - Do you want any groceries from the shop?
> - Are there any problems with your work?

`any` is also used with not to form negative sentences. In these sentences, the word any emphasizes the negativity to make it more absolute.

> Examples
>
> - She doesn't want **any kitchen appliances** for Christmas.
> - They don't need **any help** moving to their new house.
> - I don't want **any cake**.
> - There isn't **any reason** to complain.
