# Countable / Uncountable

It's important to distinguish between countable and uncountable nouns in English because their usage is different in regards to both determiners and verbs.

## Countable Nouns `[C]`

Countable nouns are for things we can count using numbers. They have a singular and a plural form. The singular form can use the determiner `a` or `an`. If you want to ask about the quantity of a countable noun, you ask **"How many?"** combined with the plural countable noun.

> Examples

| Singular  | Plural     |
| --------- | ---------- |
| one dog   | two dogs   |
| one horse | two horses |
| one man   | two men    |
| one idea  | two ideas  |
| one sheep | two sheep  |

> Examples
>
> - She has **three dogs**.
> - I own **a house**.
> - I need to buy **two books** please.
> - **How many friends** do you have?

## Uncountable Nouns `[U]`

Uncountable nouns are for the things that we cannot count with numbers. They may be the names for abstract ideas or qualities or for physical objects that are too small or too amorphous to be counted (liquids, powders, gases, etc.). Uncountable nouns are used with a singular verb. They usually do not have a plural form.

> Examples
>
> - tea
> - sugar
> - water
> - air
> - rice
> - knowledge
> - beauty
> - anger
> - fear
> - love
> - money
> - research
> - safety
> - evidence

We cannot use `a` or `an` with these nouns. To express a quantity of an uncountable noun, use a word or expression like _`some`_, _`a lot of`_, _`much`_, _`a bit of`_, _`a great deal of`_, or else use an exact measurement like _`a cup of`_, _`a bag of`_, _`1kg of`_, _`1L of`_, _`a handful of`_, _`a pinch of`_, _`an hour of`_, _`a day of`_. If you want to ask about the quantity of an uncountable noun, you ask **"How much?"**.

> Examples
>
> - There has been **a lot of research** into the causes of this disease.
> - He gave me **a great deal of advice** before my interview.
> - Can you give me **some information** about uncountable nouns?
> - He did not have **much sugar** left.
> - Measure **1 cup of water, 300g of flour, and 1 teaspoon of salt**.
> - **How much rice** do you want?

### Tricky points

Some nouns are countable in other languages but uncountable in English. They must follow the rules for uncountable nouns. The most common ones are: _`accommodation`_, _`advice`_, _`baggage`_, _`behavior`_, _`bread`_, _`furniture`_, _`information`_, _`luggage`_, _`news`_, _`progress`_, _`traffic`_, _`travel`_, _`trouble`_, _`weather`_, _`work`_

> Examples
>
> - I would like to give you **some advice**.
> - **How much bread** should I bring?
> - I didn't make **much progress** today.
> - This looks like **a lot of trouble** to me.
> - We did **an hour of work** yesterday.

Be careful with the noun _`hair`_, which is normally uncountable in English, so it is not used in the plural. It can be countable only when referring to individual hairs.

> Examples
>
> - She has **long blond hair**.
> - The **child's hair** was curly.
> - I washed **my hair** yesterday.
> - My father is getting **a few grey hairs** now. (refers to individual hairs)
> - I found **a hair** in my soup! (refers to a single strand of hair)
