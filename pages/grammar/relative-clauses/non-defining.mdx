# Non-definining Relative clauses

As the name suggests, non-defining relative clauses tell us more about someone or something, but the information in these clauses does not help us to define what we are talking about.

Take for example the sentence: "_Gorillas, **which are large and originate in Africa**_, can sometimes be found in zoos". In this sentence we are talking about all gorillas, not just some of them. The information in the non-defining relative clause tells us something more about gorillas in general. It does not define a small group of gorillas or an individual gorilla. If the non-defining relative clause were removed from the sentence, the sentence would still be grammatically correct and the meaning would not have changed, although we would have less information.

Non-defining relative clauses are composed of a relative pronoun, a verb, and optional other elements such as the subject or object of the verb. Commas or parentheses are always used to separate non-defining relative clauses from the rest of the sentence.

> Examples
>
> - _John's mother, **who lives in Scotland**_, has 6 grandchildren.
> - _My friend John, **who went to the same school as me**_, has just written a best-selling novel.
> - _My grandmother, **who is dead now**_, came from the North of England.
> - We stopped at _the museum, **which we had never visited before**_.
> - I've just come back from _London, **where John lives**_.
> - Yesterday I met a woman named _Susan, **whose husband works in London**_.

## Relative pronouns

The following relative pronouns are used in non-defining relative clauses. These relative pronouns appear at the start of the non-defining relative clause and refer to a noun that appears earlier in the sentence.

|            | Person | Thing | Place |
| ---------- | ------ | ----- | ----- |
| Subject    | who    | which |       |
|            | that   | that  |       |
|            | --     |       |       |
| Object     | who    | which | where |
|            | whom   | that  |       |
|            | that   |       |       |
|            | --     |       |       |
| Possessive | whose  | whose |       |

## Differences with defining relative clauses

In defining relative clauses, the pronouns `who`, `whom`, and `which` are often replaced by `that` in spoken English. In non-defining relative clauses, you cannot replace other pronouns with `that`. You also cannot leave out the relative pronoun in non-defining relative clauses, in the way you sometimes can in defining relative clauses. The pronoun is required, even when it is the object of the verb in the relative clause. Finally, non-defining relative clauses are always separated from the rest of the sentence by commas, unlike defining relative clauses, which have no punctuation.

> Examples
>
> - He gave me _the letter, **which was in a blue envelope**_.
>   - Non-defining clause:
>     - _There was only one letter, it happened to be blue. You must use `which`_
>
> ---
>
> - He gave me _the letter **which/that was in a blue envelope**_.
>   - Defining clause:
>     - _There were several letters of different colors and he gave me the blue one. `which` may be replaced by `that`. The commas are removed._
>
> ---
>
> - He gave me _the letter, **which I read immediately**_.
>   - Non-defining clause:
>     - _There was only one letter. `which` is the object of "read", but it still must be included in the sentence._
>
> ---
>
> - _Stratford-on-Avon, **which many people have written about**_, is Shakespeare's birthplace.
>   - Non-defining clause:
>     - _Any preposition that appears is normally placed at the end of the clause._
> - _Stratford-on-Avon, **about which many people have written**_, is Shakespeare's birthplace.
>   - Non-defining clause:
>     - _In formal written English, you can also put the preposition before the pronoun._

## Introductory expressions in non-defining clauses

Non-defining clauses can be introduced by expressions like `all of` or `many of` followed by `whom` or `which`.

`all of`, `any of`, `some of`, a `few of`, `both of`, `each of`, `either of`, `half of`, `many of`, `most of`, `much of`, `none of`, `one of`, `two of`, etc.

> Examples
>
> - There were a lot of _people_ at the party, _**many of whom I had known for years**_.
> - There are _14 girls_ in my class, _**a few of whom are my friends**_.
> - He was carrying his _belongings_, _**many of which were broken**_.
> - He had _thousands of books_, _**most of which he had read**_.
> - He picked up _a handful of stones_, _**one of which was sharp**_.

## Using `"which"` to refer to another clause

The relative pronoun `which` at the beginning of a non-defining relative clause can refer to all the information contained in the previous part of the sentence, rather than to just one word.

> Examples
>
> - Chris did really well in his exams, _**which is quite a surprise**_.
> - My friends were all hiding in my apartment, _**which isn't what I'd expected**_.
> - She's studying to become a doctor, _**which is difficult**_.
