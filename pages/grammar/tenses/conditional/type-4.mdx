# Conditional Type 4

This type of conditional refers to an unreal past condition and its probable result in the present. These sentences express a situation which is contrary to reality both in the past and in the present. In these mixed conditional sentences, **the time is the past in the "if" clause and in the present in the main clause**.

> Examples
>
> - If I had studied, I would have my driving license.
>   - _(But... I didn't study and now I don't have my license.)_
> - I would be a millionaire, now if I had taken that job.
>   - _(But... I didn't take the job and I'm not a millionaire.)_
> - If you had spent all your money, you wouldn't buy this jacket.
>   - _(But... you didn't spend all your money and now you can buy this jacket.)_

In these conditional sentences, you can also use modals in the main clause instead of would to express the degree of certainty, permission, or a recommendation about the outcome.

> Examples
>
> - If you had crashed the car, you might be in trouble.
> - I could be a millionaire now if I had invested in ABC Plumbing.
> - If I had learned to ski, I might be on the slopes right now.

## Structure

| If clause             | Main clause              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `if` + `Past Perfect` | `Simple Conditional`     |
| If this had happened, | that would happen        |
|                       | --                       |
| `if` + `Past Perfect` | `Conditional Continuous` |
| If this had happened, | that would be happening  |

As in all conditional sentences, the order of the clauses is not fixed. You may have to rearrange the pronouns and adjust punctuation when you change the order of the clauses, but the meaning is identical.

> Examples
>
> - If I had worked harder at school, I would have a better job now.
>   - I would have a better job now if I had worked harder at school.
> - If we had looked at the map, we wouldn't be lost.
>   - We wouldn't be lost if we had looked at the map.
> - If you had caught that plane, you would be dead now.
>   - You would be dead now if you had caught that plane.
