# Future Continuous

## Usage

The future continuous refers to an unfinished action or event that will be in progress at a time later than now. The future continuous is used for quite a few different purposes.

The future continuous can be used to project ourselves into the future.

> Examples
>
> - This time next week **I will be sun-bathing** in Bali.
> - By Christmas **I will be skiing** like a pro.
> - Just think, next Monday **you will be working** in your new job.

The future continuous can be used for predicting or guessing about future events.

> Examples
>
> - **He'll be coming** to the meeting, I expect.
> - I guess **you'll be feeling** thirsty after working in the sun.
> - **You'll be missing** the sunshine once you're back in England.

In the interrogative form, the future continuous can be used to ask politely for information about the future.

> Examples
>
> - **Will you be bringing** your friend to the pub tonight?
> - **Will Jim be coming** with us?
> - **Will she be going** to the party tonight?
> - **Will I be sleeping** in this room?

The future continuous can be used to refer to continuous events that we expect to happen in the future.

> Examples
>
> - **I'll be seeing** Jim at the conference next week.
> - When he is in Australia **he will be staying** with friends.
> - **I'll be eating** with Jane this evening so I can tell her.

When combined with *still*, the future continuous refers to events that are already happening now and that we expect to continue some time into the future.

> Examples
>
> - In an hour **I'll still be ironing** my clothes.
> - Tomorrow **he'll still be suffering** from his cold.
> - Next year **will she still be wearing** a size six?
> - **Won't stock prices still be falling** in the morning?
> - Unfortunately, **sea levels will still be rising** in 20 years.
