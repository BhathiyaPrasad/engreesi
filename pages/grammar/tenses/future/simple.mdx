# Simple Future

## Usage

To predict a future event:

> Examples
>
> - It **will rain** tomorrow.

With `I` or `We`, to express a spontaneous decision:

> Examples
>
> - **I'll pay** for the tickets by credit card.

To express willingness:

> Examples
>
> - I**'ll do** the washing-up.
> - He**'ll carry** your bag for you.

In the negative form, to express unwillingness:

> Examples
>
> - The baby **won't eat** his soup.
> - I **won't leave** until I've seen the manager!

With `I` in the interrogative form using "shall", to make an offer:

> Examples
>
> - **Shall I open** the window?

With `we` in the interrogative form using "shall", to make a suggestion:

> Examples
>
> - **Shall we go** to the cinema tonight?

With `I` in the interrogative form using `shall`, to ask for advice or instructions:

> Examples
>
> - What **shall I tell** the boss about this money?

With you in the interrogative form, to give an invitation:

Note: In modern English `will` is preferred to `shall`. `shall` is mainly used with `I` and `we` to make an offer or suggestion, or to ask for advice. With the other persons (`you`, `he`, `she`, `they`) `shall` is only used in literary or poetic situations.

> Examples
>
> - "With rings on her fingers and bells on her toes, She shall have music wherever she goes."
