# Comparative / Superlative

## Comparative adjectives

Comparative adjectives are used to compare differences between the two objects they modify (_`larger`_, _`smaller`_, _`faster`_, _`higher`_). They are used in sentences where two nouns are compared, in this pattern:

> `Subject<Noun>` + `Verb` + `Comparative Adjective` + than + `noun`

The second item of comparison can be omitted if it is clear from the context (final example below).

> Examples
>
> - My house is **larger** than hers.
> - This box is **smaller** than the one I lost.

## Superlative adjectives

Superlative adjectives are used to describe an object which is at the upper or lower limit of a quality (_`the tallest`_, _`the smallest`_, _`the fastest`_, _`the highest`_). They are used in sentences where a subject is compared to a group of objects.

> `Subject<Noun>` + `Verb` + the + `Superlative Adjective` + `noun`

The group that is being compared with can be omitted if it is clear from the context (final example below).

> Examples
>
> - My house is _**the largest** one_ in our neighborhood.
> - This is _**the smallest** box_ I've ever seen.

## Forming regular comparatives and superlatives

Forming comparatives and superlatives is easy. The form depends on the number of syllables in the original adjective.

### One syllable adjectives

Add `-er` for the comparative and `-est` for the superlative. If the adjective has a `consonant + short vowel + consonant` spelling, the final consonant must be doubled before adding the ending.

| Adjective | Comparative | Superlative |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| tall      | taller      | tallest     |
| fat       | fatter      | fattest     |
| big       | bigger      | biggest     |
| sad       | sadder      | saddest     |

### Two syllables

Adjectives with two syllables can form the comparative either by adding `-er` or by preceding the adjective with `more`. These adjectives form the superlative either by adding `-est` or by preceding the adjective with `most`. In many cases, both forms are used, although one usage will be more common than the other. If you are not sure whether a two-syllable adjective can take a comparative or superlative ending, play it safe and use `more` and `most` instead. For adjectives ending in `-y`, change the `-y` to an `-i` before adding the ending.

| Adjective | Comparative  | Superlative  |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| happy     | happier      | happiest     |
| simple    | simpler      | simplest     |
| busy      | busier       | busiest      |
| tilted    | more tilted  | most tilted  |
| tangled   | more tangled | most tangled |

### Three or more syllables

Adjectives with three or more syllables form the comparative by putting `more` in front of the adjective, and the superlative by putting `most` in front.

| Adjective | Comparative    | Superlative    |
| --------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| important | more important | most important |
| expensive | more expensive | most expensive |

### Irregular comparatives and superlatives

These very common adjectives have completely irregular comparative and superlative forms.

| Adjective | Comparative | Superlative |
| --------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| good      | better      | best        |
| bad       | worse       | worst       |
| little    | less        | least       |
| much      | more        | most        |
| far       | further     | furthest    |
|           | farther     | farthest    |

> Examples
>
> - Today is _**the worst** day_ I've had in a long time.
> - You are **better** at tennis than me.
