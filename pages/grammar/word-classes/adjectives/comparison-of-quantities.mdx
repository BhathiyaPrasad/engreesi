# Comparison of Quantities

## Equal Quantities

To compare two quantities that are equal, we use the pattern:

> as + `Adjective` + `(Noun)` + as

The quantity adjective you use depends if the noun in the comparison is countable or uncountable.

### Countable nouns

Use `as many` and `as few` with countable nouns. Note that the noun may be omitted when it is understood from the context, as in the last example below.

> Examples
>
> - They have **as many children as** we do.
> - We have **as many customers as** they do.
> - Tom has **as few books as** Jane.
> - There are **as few houses in his village as** in mine.
> - You know **as many people as** I do.
> - I have visited the States **as many times as** he has.
> - I have three brothers. That's **as many as** you have. _("brothers" is understood)_

### Uncountable nouns

Use `as much` or `as little` with uncountable nouns. Note that the noun may be omitted when it is understood from the context, as in the last example below.

> Examples
>
> - John eats **as much food as** Peter.
> - Jim has **as little patience as** Sam.
> - You've heard **as much news as** I have.
> - He's had **as much success as** his brother has.
> - They've got **as little water as** we have.
> - I'm not hungry. I've had **as much as** I want. _("food" is understood)_

## Unequal Quantities

To compare two quantities that are unequal, we use the pattern:

> `Adjective` + `(Noun)` + than

### Countable nouns

Use `more` and `fewer` with countable nouns. Note that the noun may be omitted when it is understood from the context, as in the last example below.

> Examples
>
> - They have **more children than** we do.
> - We have **more customers than** they do.
> - Tom has **fewer books than** Jane.
> - There are **fewer houses** in his village than in mine.
> - You know **more people than** I do.
> - I have visited the States **more times than** he has.
> - I have three brothers. That's **more than** you have. _("brothers" is understood)_

### Uncountable nouns

Use `more` or `less` with uncountable nouns. Note that the noun may be omitted when it is understood from the context, as in the last example below.

> Examples
>
> - John eats **more food than** Peter.
> - Jim has **less patience than** Sam.
> - You've heard **more news than** I have.
> - He's had **more success than** his brother has.
> - They've got **less water than** we have.
> - I'm not hungry at all. I've **had more than** I want. _("food" is understood)_
