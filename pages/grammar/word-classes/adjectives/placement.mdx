# Placement

Adjectives in English are invariable. They do not change their form depending on the gender or number of the noun.

> Examples
>
> - This is a _**hot** potato_.
> - Those are some _**hot** potatoes_.

To emphasize or strengthen the meaning of an adjective, use the adverbs `very` or `really` in front of the adjective you want to strengthen.

> Examples
>
> - This is a _**very hot** potato_
> - Those are some _**really hot** potatoes_.

Adjectives in English usually appear in front of the noun that they modify.

> Examples
>
> - The _**beautiful** girl_ ignored me.
> - The _**fast red** car_ drove away.

Adjectives can also appear after being and sensing verbs like _`to be`_, _`to seem`_, _`to look`_ & _`to taste`_.

> Examples
>
> - Italy is **beautiful**.
> - I don't think she seems **nice** at all.
> - You look **tired**.
> - This meat tastes **funny**.

## Some exceptions

Adjectives appear after the noun in some fixed expressions.

> Examples
>
> - The _Princess **Royal**_ is visiting Oxford today.
> - The _President **elect**_ made a speech last night.
> - He received a _court **martial**_ the following week.

The adjectives _`involved`_, _`present`_ & _`concerned`_ can appear either before or after the noun that they modify, but with a different meaning depending on the placement.

> Examples
>
> - **involved**
>   - I want to see the _people **involved**_.
>     - _I want to see the people who have something to do with this matter._
>   - It was an _**involved** discussion_.
>     - _The discussion was detailed & complex._
>
> ---
>
> - **present**
>   - Here is a list of the _people **present**_ at the meeting.
>     - _Here is a list of the people who were at the meeting._
>   - The _**present** situation_ is not sustainable.
>     - _I need to see the man **concerned** by this accusation._
>

>
> - **concerned**
>   - I need to see the _man **concerned**_ by this accusation.
>     - _I need to see the man who has been accused._
>   - A _**concerned** father_ came to see me today.
