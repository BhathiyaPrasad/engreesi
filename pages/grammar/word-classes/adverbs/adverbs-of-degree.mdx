# Adverbs of Degree

Adverbs of degree tell us **how much**, **intensity**, or **to what extent**. They are usually placed before other adverbs, adjectives, or verbs, but a few adverbs like _`enough`_ can be placed after the words they modify.

> Examples
>
> - The water was _**extremely** cold_. `(Adjective)`
> - The movie is _**quite** interesting_. `(Adjective)`
> - He was _**just** leaving_. `(Verb)`
> - She has _**almost** finished_. `(Verb)`
> - She is running _**very** fast_. `(Adverb)`
> - You are walking _**too** slowly_. `(Adverb)`
> - You are running _fast **enough**_. `(Adverb)`

## Usage of `enough`

Enough can be used as both an adverb and as a determiner.

### `enough` as an Adverb

Enough as an adverb meaning 'to the necessary degree' goes after the adjective or adverb that it is modifying, and not before it as other adverbs do. It can be used both in positive and negative sentences.

> Examples
>
> - Is your coffee _hot **enough**_?
> - This box isn't _big **enough**_.
> - He didn't work _hard **enough**_.
> - I got here _early **enough**_.

Enough is often followed by `"to" + the infinitive`.

> Examples
>
> - He didn't work _hard **enough**_ to pass the exam.
> - Is your coffee _hot **enough**_ to drink?
> - She's not _old **enough**_ to get married.
> - I got here _early **enough**_ to sign up.

Enough can also be followed by `"for someone"` or `"for something"`.

> Examples
>
> - The dress was _big **enough** for me_.
> - She's not _experienced **enough** for this job_.
> - Is the coffee _hot **enough** for you_?
> - He didn't work _hard **enough** for a promotion_.

### `enough` as a determiner

`enough` as a determiner meaning 'as much/many as necessary' goes before the noun it modifies. It is used with countable nouns in the plural and with uncountable nouns.

> Examples
>
> - We have _**enough** bread_.
> - You have _**enough** children_.
> - They don't have _**enough** food_.
> - I don't have _**enough** apples_.

## Usage of `too`

`too` is always an adverb, but it has two distinct meanings, each with its own usage patterns.

### `too` meaning "also"

`too` as an adverb meaning "also" goes at the end of the phrase it modifies.

> Examples
>
> - I would like to go swimming **too**, if you will let me come.
> - Can I go to the zoo **too**?
> - Is this gift for me **too**?
> - I'm not going to clean your room **too**!

### `too` meaning "excessively"

`too` as an adverb meaning "excessively" goes before the adjective or adverb it modifies. It can be used in both affirmative and negative sentences.

> Examples
>
> - This coffee is _**too** hot_.
> - He works _**too** hard_.
> - Isn't she _**too** young_?
> - I am not _**too** short_!

`too` is often followed by `"to" + the infinitive`.

> Examples
>
> - The coffee was _**too** hot_ to drink.
> - You're _**too** young_ to have grandchildren!
> - I am not _**too** tired_ to go out tonight.
> - Don't you work _**too** hard_ to have any free time?

`too` can also be followed by `"for someone"` or `"for something"`.

> Examples
>
> - The coffee was _**too** hot_ for me.
> - The dress was _**too** small_ for her.
> - He's not _**too** old_ for this job.
> - Sally's not _**too** slow_ for our team.

## Usage of `very`

`very` goes before an adverb or adjective to make it stronger.

> Examples
>
> - The girl was _**very** beautiful_.
> - The house is _**very** expensive_.
> - He worked _**very** quickly_.
> - She runs _**very** fast_.

If we want to make a negative form of an adjective or adverb, we can add `"not"` to the verb, we can use an adjective or adverb of opposite meaning, or we can use `"not very"` with the original adjective or adverb. The meanings of the phrases are not identical. Usually the phrase using `"not very"` is less direct, and thus more polite, than the other phrases.

> Examples
>
> - The girl was _beautiful_.
>   - _(Original phrase)_
> - The girl was _**not very** beautiful_.
>   - _(Opposite with "not very")_
> - The girl was _**not** beautiful_.
>   - _(Opposite with "not")_
> - The girl was **ugly**.
>   - _(Opposite with an opposite word)_
>
> ---
>
> - He worked quickly.
>   - _(Original phrase)_
> - He didn't work _**very** quickly_.
>   - _(Opposite with "not very")_
> - He did**n't** work _quickly_.
>   - _(Opposite with "not")_
> - He worked **slowly**.
>   - _(Opposite with an opposite word)_

## Difference in meaning between `very` and `too`

>
> - He speaks _**very** quickly_.
> - He speaks _**too** quickly_ for me to understand.

> - It is _**too** hot_ outside to go for a walk.

## Inversion with negative adverbs

Normally the subject goes before the verb, however, some negative adverbs can cause an inversion when placed at the beginning of the clause. The order is reversed and the verb goes before the subject. This inversion is very unusual when speaking, but many writers do this.

> - `never`
>   - I have **never** seen such courage.
