# Adverbs of Manner

Adverbs of time tell us **how** an action happened. They are usually placed after the verb, or after the object of the verb.

> Examples
>
> - He _swims **well**_.
> - He _ran **quickly**_.
> - She _spoke **softly**_.
> - James _coughed **loudly**_ to attract her attention.
> - He _plays_ the flute _**beautifully**_. (after the direct object)
> - He _ate_ the chocolate cake _**greedily**_. (after the direct object)

An adverb of manner cannot be put between a verb and its direct object. The adverb must be placed either before the verb or at the end of the clause.

> Examples
>
> - He _ate_ _**greedily**_ the chocolate cake. ❌
> - He _ate_ the chocolate cake _**greedily**_. ✅
> - He _**greedily**_ _ate_ the chocolate cake. ✅
>
> ---
>
> - He _gave_ us _**generously**_ the money. ❌
> - He _gave_ us the money _**generously**_. ✅
> - He _**generously**_ _gave_ us the money. ✅

If there is a preposition before the verb's object, you can place the adverb of manner either before the preposition or after the object.

> Examples
>
> - The child _ran **happily**_ towards his mother.
> - The child _ran_ towards his mother _**happily**_.

Adverbs of manner should always come immediately after verbs which have no object (intransitive verbs).

> Examples
>
> - The town _grew **quickly**_ after 1997.
> - He _waited **patiently**_ for his mother to arrive.

These common adverbs of manner are almost always placed directly after the verb: _`well`_, _`badly`_, _`hard`_, & _`fast`_

> Examples
>
> - He _swam **well**_ despite being tired.
> - The rain _fell **hard**_ during the storm.

The position of the adverb is important when there is more than one verb in a sentence. If the adverb is placed before or after the main verb, it modifies only that verb. If the adverb is placed after a clause, then it modifies the whole action described by the clause. Notice the difference in meaning between the following sentences.

> Examples
>
> - She _**quickly** agreed_ to re-type the letter.
>   - _=> the agreement was quick_
> - She _agreed **quickly**_ to re-type the letter.
>   - _=> the agreement was quick_
> - She agreed to _re-type_ the letter _**quickly**_.
>   - _=> the re-typing was quick_
>
> ---
>
> - He _**quietly** asked_ me to leave the house.
>   - _=> the request was quiet_
> - He _asked_ me _**quietly**_ to leave the house.
>   - _=> the request was quiet_
> - He asked me to _leave_ the house _**quietly**_.
>   - _=> the leaving was quiet_

Note: Sometimes an adverb of manner is placed before a `Verb + Object` to add emphasis in some works of literature.

> Examples
>
> - He _**gently** woke_ the sleeping woman.
> - She _**angrily** slammed_ the door.

Some writers put an adverb of manner at the beginning of the sentence to catch our attention and make us curious.

> Examples
>
> - **Slowly** she _picked up_ the knife.
> - **Roughly** he _grabbed_ her arm.
