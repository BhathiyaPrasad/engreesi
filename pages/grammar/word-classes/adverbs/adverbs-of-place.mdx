# Adverbs of Place

Adverbs of place tell us **where** something happens. Adverbs of place are usually placed after the main verb or after the clause that they modify. Adverbs of place do not modify adjectives or other adverbs. Some examples of adverbs of place: _`here`_, _`everywhere`_, _`outside`_, _`away`_, _`around`_

> Examples
>
> - John looked **around** but he couldn't see the monkey.
> - I searched **everywhere** I could think of.
> - I'm going **back** to school.
> - Come **in**!
> - They built a house **nearby**.
> - She took the child **outside**.

## `here` and `there`

_Here_ and _there_ are common adverbs of place. They give a location relative to the speaker. With verbs of movement, _here_ means "towards or with the speaker" and _there_ means "away from, or not with the speaker".

| Sentence               | Meaning                                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Come here!             | Come towards me.                          |
| The table is in here.  | Come with me; we will go see it together. |
| Put it there.          | Put it in a place away from me.           |
| The table is in there. | Go in; you can see it by yourself.        |

_Here_ and _there_ are combined with prepositions to make many common adverbial phrases.

> Examples
>
> - What are you doing **up there**?
> - Come **over here** and look at what I found!
> - The baby is hiding **down there under** the table.
> - I wonder how my driver's license got stuck **under here**.

`here` and `there` are placed at the beginning of the sentence in exclamations or when emphasis is needed. They are followed by the verb if the subject is a noun or by a pronoun if the subject is a pronoun.

> Examples
>
> - **Here** comes the bus!
> - **There** goes the bell!
> - **There** it is!
> - **Here** they are!

## Adverbs of place that are also prepositions

Many adverbs of place can also be used as prepositions. When used as prepositions, they must be followed by a noun.

> Examples
>
> - `around`
>   - The marble _rolled **around**_ in my hand. `(Adverb)`
>   - I am wearing a necklace _**around** my neck_. `(Preposition)`
> - `behind`
>   - Hurry! You are _getting **behind**_. `(Adverb)`
>   - Let's hide _**behind** the shed_. `(Preposition)`
> - `down`
>   - Mary _fell **down**_. `(Adverb)`
>   - John made his way carefully _**down** the cliff_. `(Preposition)`
> - `in`
>   - We decided to _drop **in**_ on Jake. `(Adverb)`
>   - I dropped the letter _**in** the mailbox_. `(Preposition)`
> - `off`
>   - Let's _get **off**_ at the next stop. `(Adverb)`
>   - The wind blew the flowers _**off** the tree_. `(Preposition)`
> - `on`
>   - We _rode **on**_ for several more hours. `(Adverb)`
>   - Please put he books _**on** the table_. `(Preposition)`
> - `over`
>   - He _turned **over**_ and went back to sleep. `(Adverb)`
>   - I think I will hang the picture _**over** my bed_. `(Preposition)`

## Adverbs of place ending in _`-where`_

Adverbs of place that end in _`-where`_ express the idea of location without specifying a specific location or direction.

> Examples
>
> - I would like to go **somewhere** warm for my vacation.
> - Is there **anywhere** I can find a perfect plate of spaghetti around here?
> - I have **nowhere** to go.
> - I keep running in to Sally **everywhere**!

## Adverbs of place ending in _`-wards`_

Adverbs of place that end in _`-wards`_ express movement in a particular direction.

> Examples
>
> - Cats don't usually _walk **backwards**_.
> - The ship _sailed **westwards**_.
> - The balloon _drifted **upwards**_.
> - We will keep _walking **homewards**_ until we arrive.

**Be careful:** _towards_ is a preposition, not an adverb, so it is always followed by a noun or a pronoun.

> Examples
>
> - He walked _**towards** the car_.
> - She ran _**towards** me_.

## Adverbs of place expressing both movement & location

Some adverbs of place express both movement & location at the same time.

> Examples
>
> - The child went **indoors**.
> - He lived and worked **abroad**.
> - Water always flows **downhill**.
> - The wind pushed us **sideways**.
