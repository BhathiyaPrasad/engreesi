# Comparative / Superlative

With adverbs ending in `-ly`, you must use `more` to form the comparative, and `most` to form the superlative.

| Adverb    | Comparative    | Superlative    |
| --------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| quietly   | more quietly   | most quietly   |
| slowly    | more slowly    | most slowly    |
| seriously | more seriously | most seriously |

> Examples
>
> - The teacher spoke **more slowly** to help us to understand.
> - Could you sing **more quietly** please?

With short adverbs that do not end in `-ly` comparative and superlative forms are identical to adjectives: add `-er` to form the comparative and `-est` to form the superlative. If the adverb ends in `-e`, remove it before adding the ending.

| Adverb | Comparative | Superlative |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| hard   | harder      | hardest     |
| fast   | faster      | fastest     |
| late   | later       | latest      |

> Examples
>
> - Jim works **harder** than his brother.
> - Everyone in the race ran fast, but John ran the **fastest** of all.

Some adverbs have irregular comparative and superlative forms.

| Adverb | Comparative | Superlative |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| badly  | worse       | worst       |
| far    | farther     | farthest    |
|        | further     | furthest    |
| little | less        | least       |
| well   | better      | best        |
