# Demonstratives

Demonstrative determiners show where an object, event, or person is in relation to the speaker. They can refer to a physical or a psychological closeness or distance. When talking about events, the near demonstrative determiners are often used to refer to the present while the far demonstrative determiners often refer to the past.

## Placement

Demonstratives can be placed before the noun or the adjective that modifies the noun.

> Examples
>
> - **This blue car** needs to be washed next.
> - **Those people** were here first.
> - **That metal rod** should work.
> - **These oranges** are delicious.

Demonstratives can also appear before a number by itself when the noun is understood from the context.

> Examples
>
> - I'd like to try on **that one**.
> - **This one** is broken.
> - I'll take **these three**.
> - **Those two** are not as pretty as these two.

Demonstratives can be used by themselves when the noun they modify is understood from the context.

> Examples
>
> - I'll never forget **this**.
> - **That** has nothing to do with me.
> - I didn't ask for **these**.
> - **Those** aren't mine.
