# Gender

In general there is no distinction between masculine, feminine in English nouns. However, gender is sometimes shown by different forms or different words when referring to people or animals.

| Masculine | Feminine | Neuter  |
| --------- | -------- | ------- |
| man       | woman    | person  |
| father    | mother   | parent  |
| boy       | girl     | child   |
| uncle     | aunt     |         |
| husband   | wife     | spouse  |
| actor     | actress  |         |
| prince    | princess |         |
| waiter    | waitress | server  |
| rooster   | hen      | chicken |
| stallion  | mare     | horse   |

Many nouns that refer to people's roles and jobs can be used for either a masculine or a feminine subject, like for example _`cousin`_, _`teenager`_, _`teacher`_, _`doctor`_, _`student`_, _`friend`_, _`colleague`_

> Examples
>
> - **Mary** is my friend. She is a **doctor**.
> - **Peter** is my cousin. He is a **doctor**.
> - **Arthur** is my friend. He is a **student**.
> - **Jane** is my cousin. She is a **student**.

It is possible to make the distinction for these neutral words by adding the words _`male`_ or _`female`_.

> Examples
>
> - Sam is a **female doctor**.
> - No, he is not my boyfriend, he is just a **male friend**.
> - I have three **female cousins** and two **male cousins**.

Infrequently, nouns describing things without a gender are referred to with a gendered pronoun to show familiarity. It is also correct to use the gender-neutral pronoun (it).

> Examples
>
> - I love my car. **She** (the car) is my greatest passion.
> - France is popular with **her** (France's) neighbors at the moment.
> - I traveled from England to New York on the Queen Elizabeth; **she** (the Queen Elizabeth) is a great ship.
