# Possessives

The possessive form is used with nouns referring to people, groups of people, countries, and animals. It shows a relationship of belonging between one thing and another. To form the possessive, add `apostrophe + s` to the noun. If the noun is plural, or already ends in `-s`, just add an apostrophe after the `-s`.

> Examples
>
> - the car of John = **John's car**
> - the room of the girls = **the girls' room**
> - clothes for men = **men's clothes**
> - the boat of the sailors = **the sailors' boat**

For names ending in `-s`, you can either add an `apostrophe + s`, or `just an apostrophe`. The first option is more common. When pronouncing a possessive name, we add the sound `/z/` to the end of the name.

> Examples
>
> - Thomas's book (or Thomas' book)
> - James's shop (or James' shop)
> - The Smiths's house (or The Smiths' house)

## Functions of the possessive

'Belonging to' or 'ownership' is the most common relationship the possessive expresses.

> Examples
>
> - John owns a car.
>   - _=> It is **John's car**._
> - America has some gold reserves.
>   - _=> They are **America's gold reserves**._

The possessive can also express where someone works, studies or spends time.

> Examples
>
> - John goes to this school.
>   - _=> This is **John's school**._
> - John sleeps in this room.
>   - _=> This is **John's room**._

The possessive can express a relationship between people.

> Examples
>
> - **John's mother** is running late.
> - **Mrs Brown's colleague** will not be coming to the meeting.

The possessive can express intangible things as well.

> Examples
>
> - **John's patience** is running out.
> - **The politician's hypocrisy** was deeply shocking.

### Fixed Expressions

There are also some fixed expressions where the possessive form is used.

> - a day's work
> - a month's pay
> - today's newspaper
> - in a year's time
> - For God's sake! _= exclamation of exasperation_
> - a stone's throw away _= very near_
> - at death's door _= very ill_
> - in my mind's eye _= in my imagination_

The possessive is also used to refer to shops, restaurants, churches and colleges, using the name or job title of the owner.

> Examples
>
> - Shall we go to **Luigi's** for lunch?
> - I've got an appointment at the **dentist's** at eleven o'clock.
