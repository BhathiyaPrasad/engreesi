# Asking for information

Sometimes you want to ask English people for information. In English it is not very polite to start a conversation with a direct question. For this reason we have a number of phrases.

```txt
    1. Can you tell me...?
    2. Could you tell me...?
    3. I'd like to know...
    4. D'you know...
    5. (Got/Do you have) any idea...?
    6. Could anyone tell me...?
    7. (Do/Would) you happen to know...?
    8. I don't suppose you (would) know...?
    9. I wonder if you could tell me...?
   10. I wonder if someone could tell me...?
