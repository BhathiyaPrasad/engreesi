title: "Asking for opinion"
---

It's a good idea to ask another person about their opinion before you tell them your opinion loudly and strongly. Maybe they completely disagree with you. Here are ten ways to ask.

```txt
    1. What do you think of...?
    2. What do you think about...?
    3. How d'you feel (about...)?
    4. What d'you reckon (about...)?
    5. What's your opinion of...?
    6. (What do think about) that?
    7. What are your views on...?
    8. Where do you stand (on...)?
    9. What would you say to... / if we...?
   10. Are you aware of...?
