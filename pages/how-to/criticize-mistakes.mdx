# Criticizing mistakes

Generally, it's not nice to criticize other people's mistakes but when it's a friend or the action directly affects us we may want to say something. Here are ten possible phrases.

<pre className="text-xl font-semibold font-sans leading-3">
    1. That wasn't very clever.
    2. What were you thinking of?
    3. I bet you wish you hadn't done that.
    4. Why on Earth did you go and do that?
    5. You made a right mess of that.
    6. I wouldn't do that again (in a hurry).
    7. Oops...
    8. What a total disaster!
    9. You put your foot in it (there).
   10. That was a bit uncalled for.

> __Explanations__
> - Phrases 1 and 2 are quite critical. Depending on the intonation they could be friendly criticism (big changes in pitch) or a harsh scolding (flatter intonation).
> - Phrases 3 and 4 are quite critical but almost certainly friendly or joking in tone. To achieve this effect, apply strong rise-fall intonation to "bet" in phrase 3 and "Earth" in phrase 4.
> - Phrase 5 is strongly critical and with flat intonation, not at all friendly. Using this phrase wrongly can offend people.
> - Phrases 6 and 7 are nearly always friendly in tone. In phrase 6, "that" is stressed with strong rise-fall intonation.
> - In phrase 7, "to" of "total" is stressed strongly and with flat intonation this can sound quite rude/harsh. A rise-fall intonation on this syllable makes it sound more friendly/humorous.
> - Phrases 9 and 10 are criticizing something that somebody said. Phrase 9 is criticizing indiscretion and phrase 10 is saying that something you said was offensive or rude.
