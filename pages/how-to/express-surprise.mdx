> __Explanations__
> - We say phrases 1 and 2 with rising intonation. It's important to make your voice go up at the end. You are inviting the other speaker to give you more information.
> - Phrase 3 is a general expression of surprise
> - Phrases in 4 are strong exclamations. "Blimey!" is a little rude as it literally means "God blind me!"
> - We say phrase 5 when something is completely different to what you expected - after a surprising event.
> - Phrases in 6 and 7 are saying that we really don't believe the information.
> - Phrase 8 is saying that you are so surprised that you can't speak.
> - Phrase 10 is a little old fashioned. If people say this nowadays, they are probably being sarcastic and they really mean that it isn't surprising at all.
