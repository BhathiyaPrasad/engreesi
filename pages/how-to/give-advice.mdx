# Giving advice

Sometimes other people don't know what to do and they ask us for some advice. Here are ten phrases you can use when you are making suggestions. Assume the person who asked for your advice in this instance is doing something that you believe they should stop.

```txt
    1. I reckon you should stop now.
    2. Why don't you stop now?.
    3. How about stopping now?.
    4. If I were you, I'd stop now.
    5. I suggest you stop now.
    6. You'd (really) better stop right now.
    7. I would strongly advise you to stop.
    8. My advice would be to stop now.
    9. It might be a good idea to stop.
   10. You might try stopping.
