> __Explanations__
> - We follow all the phrases with a sentence or clause that shows the speaker's opinion.
> - Phrases 1 - 3 are really quite informal. You can use these phrases when you are discussing something with friends or people who you know well.
> - In phrase 1, 'reckon' is a very common word in the UK today. It means 'I think' but British people use the word 'reckon' much more often than 'think'.
> - Phrases 5, 6 and 7 are all quite polite and show clearly that the statement is only an opinion.
> - Phrase 8 is more polite because it says to the other speaker that they might not agree with what you are saying.

> - Phrase 10 is the most polite expression of the ten. It is often written on the Internet as the abbreviation 'IMHO' or 'imho'.
