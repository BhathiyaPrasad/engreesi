# Making suggestions

We often suggest ideas or things to do. Here are some common examples with seeing a film. You can use the structures to talk about other things, of course.

```txt
    1. Why don't we go to the cinema?
    2. Let's go to the cinema. What do you think?
    3. How about going to the cinema?
    4. How do you feel about seeing a film?
    5. Fancy seeing a film?
    6. I'd like to see a film. How about you?
    7. We could always see a film.
    8. Why not go and see a film?
    9. Seeing a film's one idea.
   10. It would be nice to see a film.
