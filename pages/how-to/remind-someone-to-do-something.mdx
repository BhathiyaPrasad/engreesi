> - In phrase 3, you need to put stress on the word "will".

> - After phrases 6 and 7, you need to use a noun or a noun phrase. For example: _I'd like to remind you about **the party** tomorrow night_.
> - After phrase 10 we use a clause (mini sentence). For example: _May I remind all passengers that **smoking is not allowed**_.
