# Talking about good ideas

With friends, at work and in many other situations we ask for ideas and respond to them. Here are some useful ways of saying you like someone's idea.

```txt
    1. That's a great idea.
    2. That's an idea.
    3. Good idea!
    4. What a great idea!
    5. I think that's a fantastic idea.
    6. I like that idea.
    7. I like the idea of that.
    8. That's not a bad idea.
    9. You know what? That's a good idea.
   10. Cool!
