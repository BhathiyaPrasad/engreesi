# Talking about improbability

We don't know what will happen in the future. But sometimes there are things that we don't think will happen (e.g. England winning the World Cup). We use these ten phrases.

```txt
    1. I don't expect they'll win.
    2. It's (quite) unlikely they'll win.
    3. They are not very likely to win.
    4. I shouldn't think they'll win.
    5. There's not much hope / chance.
    6. I'd be (very) surprised if they won.
    7. I wouldn't bet on them winning.
    8. There's no chance of them winning.
    9. There's little likelihood of them winning..
   10. It'll never happen in a month of Sundays.
