title: "\"I feel relieved\""
---

Sometimes we think that something terrible is going to happen and then in the end it doesn't happen at all. Here are ten phrases that we use to show our relief.

<pre className="text-xl font-semibold font-sans leading-3">
    1. Phew!
    2. Thank God (for that)!
    3. What a relief!
    4. I'm so relieved to hear that.
    5. You had me worried (there / for a moment).
    6. That's a weight off my mind.
    7. You've no idea what a relief it is to hear
    8. That's one less thing to worry about.
    9. What a stroke of luck!
   1.  (Oh well.) All's well that ends well!
