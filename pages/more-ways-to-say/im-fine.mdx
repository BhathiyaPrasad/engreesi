When somebody asks you **"How are you?"**, there are many different ways to say that we feel well.

<pre className="text-xl font-semibold font-sans leading-3">
    1. I'm fine thank you.
    2. I feel great/marvelous/fine.
    3. Couldn't be better.
    4. Fit as a fiddle.
    5. Very well, thanks.
    6. Okay.
    7. Alright.
    8. Not bad.
    9. Much better.
   10. All the better for seeing you.

> __Explanations__
> - Many students only learn phrase 1. Try to learn some more expressions.
> - Phrase 2 is very positive. Marvelous is probably the strongest.
> - Phrase 3 is saying that it is impossible to be more healthy/well.
> - Phrase 4 is an idiom that says you feel very fit and healthy.
> - Phrases 6, 7 and 8 are positive but not strong. People sometimes say these when they don't feel very well but they want to be polite.
> - We say phrase 9 when we were sick before and now feel (more) well.
> - Phrase 10 is the friendliest phrase. We are saying that seeing the other person has made us feel healthier and happier. Don't use this with strangers.
