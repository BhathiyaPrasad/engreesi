Imagine your friend says "I'm going to president one day". In English, we have a number of phrases to say that we think the other person is being totally unrealistic.

<pre className="text-xl font-semibold font-sans leading-3">
    1. As if!
    2. In your dreams!
    3. You wish!
    4. No chance!
    5. Not a chance!
    6. Not likely!
    7. Dream on!
    8. Never in a million years!
    9. You'll be lucky!
   1.  Yes, and pigs might fly!
</pre>

> __Explanations__
> - Phrases 1, 2, and 3 not only show disbelief but are also quite dismissive of the person who made the prediction.
> - Phrases 4 and 5 are indicating that you think the prediction is totally impossible.
> - Phrase 6 is a little more tentative. You concede that there may be a small chance.
> - Phrase 7 suggests that you think the other person is just day-dreaming.
> - Phrases 9 and 10 are a little sarcastic. In phrase ten you are saying that the prediction is no more likely than pigs suddenly being able to fly.
