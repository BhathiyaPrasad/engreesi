> __Explanations__
> - Phrases 1 and 2 are fairly polite. If you really want to be polite you could make an apology first e.g. 'I'm sorry to disagree, but...'
> - Phrases 3 and 4 are a little stronger and a little less polite.
> - You follow phrase 4 with a noun phrase or a gerund.

> - Phrases 8 and 9 are actually quite rude. Even people who know each other quite well may not say these phrases to each other.
> - Phrase 10 is followed by a sentence or clause with the correct information.
