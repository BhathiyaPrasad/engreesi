We all need help sometimes. In English, it is not polite to ask directly. So there are many phrases that we can say before a request to 'soften' it. Here are ten such phrases.

```txt
    1. Can you give me a hand with this?
    2. Could you help me for a second?
    3. Can I ask a favour?
    4. I wonder if you could help me with this?
    5. I could do with some help, please.
    6. I can't manage. Can you help?
    7. Give me a hand with this, will you?
    8. Lend me a hand with this, will you?
    9. Could you spare a moment?
   10. I need some help, please.
