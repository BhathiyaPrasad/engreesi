Sometimes we can't remember things from the past and sometimes we forget to do important things in the present. We can use these ten phrases for these situations.

```txt
    1. (I'm afraid) I can't remember.
    2. I've completely forgotten.
    3. My mind's gone blank
    4. (Sorry) I have no memory of...
    5. (I'm afraid) it doesn't ring a bell.
    6. I have no recollection of...
    7. Sorry, I forgot.
    8. I simply forgot to do it.
    9. What was I thinking of?
   10. Oh no, it completely slipped my mind.
