Do you have a good memory? You can probably remember many things from the past. These are ten phrases that English people use when they are recalling things from the past.

```txt
    1. I remember...
    2. I can (clearly) remember...
    3. I'll never forget...
    4. As far as I can remember...
    5. As I recall...
    6. If I remember correctly...
    7. If I'm not / Unless I'm - mistaken...
    8. Now I come to think of it...
    9. I have a vague recollection of...
   10. It's on the tip of my tongue.
