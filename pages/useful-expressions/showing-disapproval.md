Sometimes we hear about an action that somebody else has done and we feel very negative about it. Here are ten phrases that English people use to show their disapproval.

```txt
    1. I don't think much of that.
    2. How appalling/dreadful!
    3. I'm utterly appalled/disgusted.
    4. I'm dead against people doing...
    5. It shouldn't be allowed!
    6. What a rotten/mean thing to do.
    7. I take a very dim view of people doing...
    8. Who do they think they are?
    9. How can people do things like that?
   10. Whatever next?
