Here are some ways of talking about what we think might happen, when we don't really know.

```txt
    1. No doubt the Joneses will be there.
    2. It's unlikely that she'll come now.
    3. I bet/You can bet (that) they'll be late.
    4. I imagine (that) it'll be busy.
    5. The chances are that he'll win.
    6. There's no chance of them coming now.
    7. In all probability, it will be raining.
    8. My guess is that she'll lose.
    9. There's just a chance that it will work.
   10. I wouldn't be surprised if it rained.
