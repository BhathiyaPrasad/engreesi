      Verbs that have been marked with a single asterik (<strong>*</strong>) are irregular verbs, the V2 and V3 of which you need to memorize. If a verb is marked with double asteriks (<strong>**</strong>), it means that verb may take "-ed" to form the V2 and V3 forms or it may use its irregular forms.
