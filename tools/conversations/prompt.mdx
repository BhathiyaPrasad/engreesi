Generate a conversation where student forgot to do their homework and is having a conversation with their teacher.

I'm trying to use this to teach English to Sri Lankan students. Use the following template for this conversation.

Replace __SPEAKER_1__ with the name of the first speaker, and __SPEAKER_2__ with the second.
Replace __UTTERANCE_BY_SPEAKER_1__ with the line spoken by the first speaker and do similarly with __UTTERANCE_BY_SPEAKER_2__ and the line spoken by the second.
There should be at least 5 utterances by each speaker, and the conversation must come to a natural end.

Then decide a title for the conversation and replace __TITLE__ with that.

Then describe the context and replace that in __CONTEXT__.

title: "Conversation: __TITLE__"
description: "__CONTEXT__"

# __TITLE__

> __CONTEXT__
